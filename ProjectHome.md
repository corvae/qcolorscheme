# ALERT: I DERP HARD SO I'M STILL FIXING #

QColorScheme allows easy color schemes for PyQt apps without fiddling with Stylsheets.

**A word of warning:**

This is currently an early alpha and there might be breaking
changes done to the class.
So for now this is not for the faint of heart!

~~Also there is next to no documentation besides the provided example app.~~

I have added a minimal getting started page to the wiki. More to come as the class evolves.
